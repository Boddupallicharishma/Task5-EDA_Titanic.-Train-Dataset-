# Task 5: Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis

## 👩‍💻 Author
Boddupalli Charishma

## 📌 Objective
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to discover trends, relationships, and anomalies using visual and statistical tools.

## 📁 Dataset
- Sample Titanic dataset included: titanic_sample.csv

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Techniques Applied
- .info(), .describe(), .value_counts()
- Histograms, Boxplots, Barplots
- Correlation Heatmap
- Summary statistics and visual observations

## 📝 Key Insights
- Higher-class passengers (1st class) had better survival chances.
- Age and Fare play important roles in survival prediction.
- Females had higher survival rates.
- Missing values were observed in 'Age' and 'Cabin' columns.
